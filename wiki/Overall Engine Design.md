## TODO
1. Switch to a better IDE, one with support for one of the popular Lua documentation tools (LDocs, etc...)
2. In `cat-paw/` put a few comments - what is essential to the understanding of some bit of code, etc...
3. In `docs/` mirror the structure of `cat-paw/` but each file will be populated with only comments, fully documenting that
